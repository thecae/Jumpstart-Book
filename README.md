# Jumpstart Book

This book was designed to fill the gap between an online virtual environment for Algebra II and Suncoast High School's rigorous pre-calculus curriculum.  Knowing that virtual Algebra II was causing students to not have the necessary knowledge to be successful in pre-calculus, Suncoast designed a two-week summer program to help reinforce the essential Algebra II skills and serve as a welcome to Suncoast.  This book is a curriculum companion to that program.

> *Suncoast High School is a magnet school for math, science, and engineering.  The school is located in Riviera Beach, Florida.  The school's website is [here](http://www.suncoasthighschool.us/).*

## Book Contents

This book covers 14 chapters of content that are essential to success in pre-calculus.  The chapters are:
1. Function Basics
2. Complex Numbers
3. Linear Functions and Relations
4. Quadratic Functions
5. Higher-Order Polynomial Functions
6. Rational Functions
7. Radical Functions
8. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
9. Piece-wise Functions
10. Systems of Equations
11. Trigonometry
12. Conic Sections
13. Inequalities
14. Essentials for AP Physics I

These chapters are designed to be completed in order. Most of the content is review from Algebra II, but some topics might be new depending on their curriculum.  The book places special emphasis on problem-solving skills, algebra theory, and graphing.  The book is designed to be completed in two weeks, but can be completed in a shorter or longer time depending on the student's needs.

## Book Features

The book is designed to be accompanied by an in-person classroom experience.  Although this book is intended to be comprehensive enough to study alone, there is an expectation that students have a base knowledge in Algebra to be successful.  This book is specially designed to correlate to the needs of the teachers of the Jumpstart curriculum and caters both to advanced and struggling students.  There are plenty of problems (*and an accompanying solution manual*) to help students reinforce their learning and practice outside the classroom.

## Book Design

This book was written purely in $\LaTeX$ by a high-school me.  This book is prepared for publishing; however, we found that it was simply easier to digitally distribute the book to students.

The following packages were used in the creation of this book:
* A custom class file for formatting: `elegantbook.cls` (Modified from [this template](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantLaTeX/blob/master/elegantbook.cls))
* The `longdiv` package for displaying long division ([source code](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/longdiv))
* Tikz - A package for drawing graphs and diagrams
* pgfplots - A package for drawing graphs and diagrams
* Asymptote - A package for drawing 3D graphs and diagrams
* amsmath, amsfonts, amssymb - Packages for math formatting
* graphicx - A package for displaying images
* wrapfig - A package for wrapping text around images
* xcolor - A package for coloring text
* fancyvrb - A package for formatting code
* multicol, multirow - Packages for formatting tables
* booktabs - A package for formatting tables
